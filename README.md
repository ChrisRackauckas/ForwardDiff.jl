The `ForwardDiff` package provides an implementation of forward mode automatic differentiation in Julia.

The package currently provides functions for evaluating gradients, Jacobians and Hessians.

Please note that the package is undergoing development. It will support evaluation of tensors among else.
Documentation will also be provided soon. In the meantime, some examples are available in the `test` folder.
