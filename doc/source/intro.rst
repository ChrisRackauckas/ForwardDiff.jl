Introduction
================================================================================

Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FAD) can be implemented in various ways. The present package aims at realizing
several FAD implementations in Julia. The main motivation behind this aim is to utilize the heterogeneous advantages of
the different coding approaches to FAD.

FAD Implementations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A synopsis of the FAD implementations of the package is set out below.

**FAD Using Dual Numbers**

One available FAD approach makes use of dual numbers, which are represented by the *Dual* type in the *DualNumbers*
package.

**Type-Based FAD**

**Matrix FAD Using Kronecker and Box Products**

**Power Series FAD Using Generalized Dual Numbers**

The Main API
